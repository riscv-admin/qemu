# QEMU SIG

The QEMU SIG aims to:

* Coordinate with the upstream QEMU community and RISC-V contributors;
* Identify gaps and maintain a status/roadmap for RISC-V support in QEMU;
* Recruit reviewers and contributors to QEMU within the RISC-V ecosystem;
* Provide guidance and training for other groups within RISC-V that contribute to QEMU (e.g., as part of the Acceptance Criteria  for new extensions) and assist/coordinate the upstreaming of RISC-V specific contributions;

The group will work closely with the Applications & Tools HC and coordinate with the other HCs and ICs to ensure that QEMU supports the ongoing standardisation efforts within RISC-V.
